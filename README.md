# SANSKRIT
This repository contains the code for my online Sanskrit tuition website. It provides information about classes for all levels, including postgraduate students, covering grammar, literature, and linguistics. The site features a responsive design, details about the syllabus, contact info, and a Google Pay QR code for easy payment.
